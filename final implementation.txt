1. Getting all Terminals(literals) for a given Grammar

2. Getting the Next Possible Terminals for a symbol already chosen by a user for a given production of a grammar.

Basically, we knew what grammar to look for, which  production to go via chosenProductionIndex
and even which symbolIndex we are going to introspect next via (chosenSymbolIndex + 1).

Here there could be many corner cases as follows:

1. what if the symbol that was already chosen by the user is the last symbol of the production? If yes, where to go next?

2. When there are more symbols yet to process in that production and the symbol that is next to user's choice is a Terminal?

3. When there are more symbols yet to process in that production and the symbol that is next to user's choice is a Non-Terminal?

3.1. while fetching the suggestions in case of a Non-Terminal, the suggestion themselves belongs to some other grammar?
How are we going to keep track where goes what?
